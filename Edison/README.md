# Edison

For the Edison
To deploy (only need to do this once initially, once again if start-script.py
or deploy.sh are updated):

Change path to BASH script to the correct system-dependent script path in
run-python.sh and path to Python script in start-script.py (depends on how you
cloned the script).

(chmod u+x deploy.sh if needed)

Run
./deploy.sh
